# Google Authenticator Malware investigation - SOC Investigation.

**Summary:**  
This documents a malware infection resulting from a fake Google Authenticator. The investigation was conducted using Wireshark from malware-traffic-analysis.net.

**Victim Details:**  
This internal IP falls within the organization's LAN segment, indicating the compromised host is on the local network. It was identified as the source of suspicious outbound traffic, including HTTP requests to malicious domains.
MAC address was extracted from ARP and Ethernet frames in the PCAP, confirming the physical network interface of the infected machine. This can be used to isolate the host on the network switch.
The Hostname was revealed through Kerberos authentication traffic. This identifies the specific workstation involved, aiding in forensic imaging.
The Username appeared in Kerberos tickets and HTTP user-agent strings during the infection chain. This suggests the user initiated the search and download, possibly via a web browser.

**Infection Vector:**  
The authenticatoor.org impersonates as a legitimate Google Authenticator and was used to host the malicious executable. Traffic analysis shows the user was redirected here after clicking a malicious ad in search results, but it led to unauthorized sites like burleson-appliance.net. 

**Post Infection:**  
The external IPs were involved in callback traffic post-infection handling C2 communications. They appear in outbound TCP sessions and may host encrypted payloads or exfiltrated channels. The pcap revealed  HTTPS connections to these addresses, including check-in URLs with unique identifiers for the infected host.
